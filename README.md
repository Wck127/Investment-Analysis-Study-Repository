An evolving python basics and Excel-based repository designed to translate core investment return and performance concepts into practical, structured, and repeatable models. This project focuses on bridging theory and real-world portfolio analysis by organizing key calculations used in asset management, trading, and investment evaluation. As formulas are added I will pick a few to create working examples with my own scenarios to better reinfoce these concepts. 

Built as a hands-on companion to ongoing capital markets and portfolio management study, this toolkit will continue expanding as additional methodologies and applications are added.
